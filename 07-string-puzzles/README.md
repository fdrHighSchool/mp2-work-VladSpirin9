# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
    `Returns the characters starting from 'a' and to the end of the string.`

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
    `Returns the characters starting from 'a' and ending at 'b'(the 'b' itself is not included).`

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
    `Returns the index of a string.`

  * `.equals(str)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
    `Compares two strings and returns true if they are equals and false if they are not.`


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * **YOUR WRITING HERE**
  `It iterates a sets of statements for String s equal to its length.`
